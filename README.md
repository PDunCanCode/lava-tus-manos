#### React Movie

A fun little app I built to interact with the Movie DB API. Similiar to IMDB functionality, but less robust.

I used React Hooks, Functional Components, and StyledComponents. I had some trouble mapping over the returned arrays for a bit, but I was able to console.log the situation out to my custom useMovieFetch Hook. Once those fetch errors were corrected the rest was down hill and I'm overall super stoked on the project.
